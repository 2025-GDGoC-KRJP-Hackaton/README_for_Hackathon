## 🛠️ What is [The Bridge]?

The Bridge is a two-phase hackathon focused on building and growing open-source AI applications:

1. **Sprint Phase** (May 17–18)  
   In this 2-day hackathon, each team builds a working prototype of an AI application.

2. **Sustain & Maintain Phase**  
   In the weeks following the hackathon, teams are encouraged to improve, polish, and maintain their projects as open-source contributions.

## 🧩 Why Open Source?

We believe in the power of **collaboration**, **transparency**, and **collective learning**.  
By making our projects open source, we not only invite others to share ideas and build upon our work,  
but we also practice the mindset of *starting first*—not waiting for permission or perfection.

Open source allows us to:

- Learn by doing  
- Contribute to the global developer community  
- Build tools that others can use, learn from, or improve

## 📂 How to Submit on Hackathon Day

1. **Check your team number.**

2. **Find your team’s repository**  
   Each team has been assigned a repository under this GitHub Organization based on team number.

   Example:  
   👉 [Team-5 Repository](https://github.com/2025-GDGoC-KRJP-Hackaton/Team-5)

3. **Push your local repository** to the corresponding team repository on GitHub.

   Please ensure your commits are pushed to the correct repository.  
   Avoid overwriting or modifying other teams’ repositories.

   ⚠️ **Interfering with another team’s repository may result in a penalty.**
